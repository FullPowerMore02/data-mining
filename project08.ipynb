            "News Content: Bitcoin (BTC) is painfully close to recording an ominous first in its 14-year history: its premiere “death cross” on the weekly price chart.\n",
            "\n",
            "Two major moving averages (MA) are about to converge: its 200-week and its 50-week. Technical analysis suggests it is extremely bearish for the 50-week MA to cross below a 200-week MA — hence the “death” part.\n",
            "\n",
            "Death crosses are lagging indicators. The pattern is typically used by investors and traders as a signal that a trend change from bullish to bearish is about to, or has, taken place.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitcoin switched from a heady bull market to a stifling bear market sometime in late 2021 or early 2022 — the impending death cross would solidify that switch and mark the most visceral reversal in its history.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitcoin narrowly avoided a death cross back in November 2015 (the early days of a bull run), when just $9.96 separated the 50-week and 200-week MAs ($9.96 was about 2.6% of bitcoin’s price at the time).\n",
            "\n",
            "As of 12:50 am, ET, just $115 separated the two. That’s just 0.5% of bitcoin’s price — its closest ever point.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitcoin’s first ever weekly “death cross” will occur when the light blue line sinks below the dark blue line, likely sometime in the next few days\n",
            "\n",
            "Death crosses can be seen on any asset chart. Following the bursting of the dotcom bubble — in Sept. 2001 — the S&P 500 printed such a pattern about a year and a half after the index peaked. Prices eventually bottomed out 300 days later.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s important to note that technical analysis should not be used in isolation. And depending on who you ask, technical analysis is either useful or junk science (Blockworks requested comments from three different analysts about the death cross — all declined to weigh in on technical analysis).\n",
            "\n",
            "Still, charting remains popular in crypto circles as there’s often little else to go on (fundamental analysis remains elusive in crypto compared to traditional equities, which boast price-to-earnings, price-to-book ratios and other useful metrics).\n",
            "\n",
            "Ether (ETH), on the other hand, is still some ways from printing such a melancholic pattern. Although it has seen a weekly death cross before: in June 2019, one and a half years after 2017-2018 bull market topped out.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some 18 months later, ETH’s 200MA and 50MA would conversely cross “bullish” in December 2020 with a so-called “golden cross” — the opposite of a “death cross.”\n",

            "\n",
            "According to Micheal Ugwu, angel investor CEO of FreeMe Digital, bitcoin is on the rise because economic metrics in the US weren’t as bad as it was expected to be. For example, the inflation rate dropped from 7.10% to 6.5%, making traders optimistic that interest rates would drop.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the past, Bitcoin was one way to hedge against inflation, but it didn’t do that in 2022. The cryptocurrency is behaving similar to the stock market playing to the tunes of micro and macroeconomic factors.\n",
            "\n",
            "The rise has also been attributed to the activities of whales. These are people or entities that purchase large quantities of cryptocurrencies enough to move the market.\n",

            "According to crypto data firm Kaiko, trade sizes have gone from an average of $700 to $1,100 on Binance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Micheal Saylor, CEO of Microstrategy, is a well-known crypto whale who bought $45 million worth of Bitcoin in December 2022. When whales sweep up cryptocurrencies in large volumes, it reduces the supply of crypto, which leads to an increase in prices.\n",

            "The third reason for the hike in the price of bitcoin is the increasing mining difficulty. BTC.com data revealed that mining difficulty is now at 37.6 trillion, which means it will take 37.6 trillion attempts to find a valid bitcoin block and add it to the blockchain.\n",

            "\n",
            "While some economic factors are panning out well for bitcoin, it doesn't mean things will stay the same. According to Ugwu, the economic situation in the US doesn’t change the macro economic conditions, which will affect crypto in the long run.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to the World Bank, the global economy is projected to grow by 1.7% in 2023, a sharp downturn in growth. Judging by what happened in 2022, this figure could be worse than the World Bank's prediction.\n",

            "Even worse, the recession the World Bank envisions is going to be broad-based, with everyone everywhere in the world experiencing a significant slowdown in their earnings.\n",

Founded in 2017, BAP stands firmly in support of financial freedom. The liberty that cryptocurrency and decentralized banking provides globally requires an infrastructure that Bitcoin ATM Pros is building. In 2020 the company founded its Crypto exchange. A year later, on July 1st, 2021, they launched the token, and, not long after, the Face to Face Crypto exchange was opened in February 2021. Founder Michael is proud of the young company's massive success and glad this passion project has been able to make a difference. \"I originally began this endeavor because I felt governments had too much control over us and our money. Many countries in Africa change currencies so often, farmers go broke every 5 years because the money they made is now obsolete.

            "BAP also boasts a unique, and attractive dividend payout structure. According to Founder Michael, \"We already have profitable utilities and our dividend structure is set up for our token holders.\" With this structure in place, 10% of all the profits from their ATMs and Over-The-Counter exchange will be given back to the token holders every quarter in the form of tokens, and eventually, Ethereum. So how does this work? The token holder will be paid out in BAP tokens until the tokens are all gone, then they will be paid in Ethereum from then on. Essentially, the longer one holds the tokens, the more money they will make regardless of the price. This is a residual income token. They've already paid out over $55k in tokens to BAP holders in the first 2 dividends.\n",
            "\n",
            "In time BAP will be setting up a call line, people can call in and ask questions about crypto or how it can better serve them in their needs. This call line and service will be absolutely free. They really want to educate the masses on this amazing opportunity that crypto currency and the BAP token have to offer. It's more about getting the people in need to a place of peace and wellness with their finances. Life is hard enough as it is, we all need a helping hand every now and again. BAP is here with that hand for you!\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Here at BAP we will be adding many more products and services, such as a platform for processing fiat and crypto payment, and debit cards for our users of the exchange. More OTCs. 3D printing house projects in Africa and Mongolia and other countries that need financial services and a better life that we can help them with. When we came to these countries, we honestly didn't know what all they needed \"there\" yet. So additional products could be 40x40 algae biodiesel fields in a community that could use it. We will charge a fee for anything we want to sell to the government and give a % of that back to token holders. But the goal is to stay open to what might be needed in areas where we haven't personally been or seen what is needed. Our project as a whole, is much bigger than just one company or one person. It's about changing the world for the better wherever we can, and the token holders get paid for helping us help others.\" CEO - Michael Cuillard\n",
            "\n",
            "Once in the BAP family, token holders can sit back and watch the quarterly dividends come rolling in, as the BAP way of saying thank you for the investment and faith in the company! As a community-based team, driven to take care of those in financial hardships. There are too many cities, communities, countries, and entire nations that do not have reliable banking methods or even a legitimate currency structure. For these reasons, BAP has made it its mission to combat this issue using its cryptocurrency in the process.\n",

            "News Content: A couple of enterprising Tesla owners have been using their electric cars to mine for cryptocurrencies or privacy tokens like Monero. According to them, the most profitable way to mine for crypto with a Tesla is to use a hacked firmware and hook graphics processing units directly to the electric motor. One Tesla Model 3 owner reveals that this way he was able to net up to $800 a month in Ethereum when the cryptocurrency was at its record price.\n",

            "Teslas, or any fully electric car, for that matter, are basically a giant computer on wheels, thought one Model 3 owner, and decided he can use the EV to mine crypto. Siraj Raval used every trick in the mining book - from connecting video cards to Tesla's battery, through hooking up their Apple Mac mini M1 to the 12V socket. He says that he was able to net $800/month in Ethereum's price heyday this way. According to him, the most profitable way to mine for crypto with a Tesla car is to use \"a mix of hacking into Tesla’s internal computer, plus plugging GPUs directly into the car’s electric motor.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Another Tesla owner, Chris Allessi, has gone even further. Since he got his Tesla before January 2017, he is entitled to a lifetime of superfast charging for the EV, and has used the free electricity from the car's battery to dig for Bitcoin with a Bitmain Antminer S9 directly. Alternatively, he has also tried hacking the Tesla's firmware and mining via the car's screen and browser by setting up a webpage that lets him dig for the Monero privacy token. \"It was no big deal,\" comments Alessi - Wisconsin’s first electric car dealer and a tinkerer by nature - \"I could run the mining program within the browser.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "How much did he make this way with his Tesla? A $10 worth of bitcoin for 60 hours as Tesla's GPU has a rather paltry 10 MH/s hashrate. Siraj Raval fared better, as he buys his GPUs used off eBay, mines for about 20 hours a day, and stakes the crypto with an exchange that gives him a good interest rate. This way he was able to net $400 to $800 a month while mining for crypto with his Tesla Model 3 last year. Still, according to Mr. Alessi, the whole Tesla Bitcoin mining exercise is just a proof of concept and not worth it in the long run:\n",

            "The appeal of engaging with an industry without government interference is also seen by some like Emeç as a reason to invest. “I call on people to move towards these liberating [trading] platforms – this is my mission, basically. It’s a way of life,” he said.\n",

            "Emeç said continuing to invest in cryptocurrency was the only way for him to recoup $10m in digital currency trading losses and a Bitcoin scam that cost him more than $1m. “It’s a very volatile market, so I can only get that amount of money back through the same market,” he said.\n",

            "Bitcoin has fallen from its mid-November high of about $69,000 to a low of about $35,000 this week, meaning some athletes have essentially taken a 50% pay cut for the same amount of work, assuming they didn't immediately sell their bitcoin for traditional US dollars upon receipt.\n",

            "Complicating bitcoin salaries even further is the tax implications, as you are taxed on the value of bitcoin when you receive it, not on what the value fluctuates too come tax season.

            "Bitcoin's market cap has ballooned to roughly $820 billion, more than a third of all value among cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's rate of appreciation may slow down at this large size, making a bear market possible for Bitcoin in 2022 if investors cool off toward it.\n",

            "Is Bitcoin due for a soft year?\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitcoin is up more than 29,800% over its lifetime, showing just how ridiculously good of an investment it's been for early investors. The price has continued multiplying, up by roughly six times over the past two years, but just 20% over the past 12 months.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitcoin is currently down after setting an all-time high in late 2021. To be sure, nobody can predict the price action of cryptocurrencies. But Bitcoin doesn't have earnings or free cash flow like stocks do, which can be a compass of sorts for valuing them. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are mainly a function of supply and demand.\n",
            "\n",
            "Suppose investors begin shying away from \"buying the dip\" because of Bitcoin's negative price momentum. In that case, investors could see a soft 2022 for it and other cryptos, especially after the massive price action seen from 2020 and 2021.\n",
            "\n",
            "Foundry for Crypto can help the industry\n",
            "\n",
            "Cryptocurrencies have become popular for several reasons; they operate on blockchain technology, a type of ledger that publicly tracks each transaction as an ongoing chain so that people can't change it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Blockchain technology means that cryptocurrencies are decentralized; they aren't managed by a single party, like how the government controls the U.S. dollar. The unregulated nature of cryptocurrency is a plus for many crypto investors, but there could be hurdles that slow down how decentralized currencies are adopted by society.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, the cryptocurrency space has become a Wild West of sorts, where scams are rampant, and coin \"pump and dump\" schemes typically leave investors with losses after the founders abandon the project once they make money.\n",
            "\n",
            "Palantir's Foundry is a software-as-a-service data platform that interacts with data to help users make actionable decisions. It can integrate data, perform analytics, build models, map, and track decision-making. It's almost like Iron Man's power armor; it doesn't function by itself, but it makes a superhero when combined with the user.\n",
            "\n",
            "Palantir launched Foundry for Crypto to gain exposure to the growth of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. Foundry for Crypto lists offerings including anti-money laundering, fraud detection, intelligence for decentralized applications, and analytics across blockchains. It's still very early, and Palantir will need to elaborate on the program's progress over the coming quarters and years. Still, Foundry could prove a valuable tool in a space where security and regulation are lacking. Cryptocurrency is still speculative, but some estimate that it could grow into an enormous field, which could be a massive opportunity for Palantir over the long term.\n",

            "\n",
            "Palantir's price-to-sales ratio has declined on a forward basis from nearly 48 to under 17 because the company's revenue keeps growing while the share price drops. Meanwhile, free cash flow has turned positive over the past year, a great sign that the business is on a path to profitability. Adjusted free cash flow was $119 million in Palantir's most recent reporting period, the third quarter of 2021, up from a negative $53 million in 2020.\n",
            "\n",
            "The stock's reduced valuation could be a great buying opportunity as the business is turning a corner producing free cash flow. Management has maintained a long-term revenue growth projection of at least 30% per year over the next four years.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the market begins favoring fast-growing companies again, Palantir's improving financials and signs of continued growth in future quarters could make it a big winner in 2022.\n",

A reminder that Bitcoin is a risk-on asset or in other words a liquidity haven, the pre-Covid view that Bitcoin was a safe-haven had been well and truly debunked when Bitcoin had cratered during the Q1 2020 sell-off. Thanks to the global central bank and government largess, the crypto space has been among the top performers of the “buy everything rally”. Therefore, with the Federal Reserve talking up balance sheet normalisation to come much sooner than many had expected, the potential near-term withdrawal of liquidity poses a threat to the crypto space and likely what we are seeing now, is cryptos discounting that future withdrawal of liquidity. The chart below provides a reminder as to how Bitcoin performed during QT in 2018. Admittedly, this is just a sample size of 1, not to mention it also came after a blow-off top at 20k. However, with institutional involvement much higher now than in 2018, macros matter more than ever before.\n",

That being said, for those who remain a Bitcoin bull, it would be preferable for a false break below 40k, much like what we have seen previously at psychological levels.\n",

In terms of the jobs report, the headline figure surprised on the upside and thus shows Canadian employment is now 240,500 above the level it was in February 2020. However, it is important to note that the figures do not cover the impact of Omicron, given that the reference week was December 5-11th. Therefore, with the surge in Omicron cases and subsequent lockdown happening since then, the numbers are slightly outdated. That said, USD/CAD is testing support at 1.2620-30, below which opens the doors to the BoC Dec meeting low at 1.2604.

As a company whose shares trade on a major stock exchange, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sector and traditional capital markets. HIVE owns state-of-the-art, green energy-powered data center facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we endeavor to source green energy to mine digital assets such as Bitcoin on the cloud. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its treasury of ETH and BTC derived from mining rewards. Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of Bitcoin. Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space.\n",

            "\n",
            "Josh Olszewicz, head of research at crypto fund manager Valkyrie Investments, told Blockworks that while there are long-term buying opportunities for companies seeking to incorporate BTC into corporate balance sheets, impairment costs remain a concern.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitcoin is subject to impairment losses if the fair value of bitcoin decreases below the carrying value during the assessed period. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently reviewing impairment costs associated with digital assets on the balance sheet.\n",
            "\n",
            "“If the reporting methods are adjusted by the FASB and the impairment costs are lifted for select digital assets, such as bitcoin, corporate adoption is likely to increase,” Olszewicz said. “Bitcoin on the balance sheet will then accurately reflect realistic market prices rather than the lowest price while the asset is being held.”\n",

            "\n",
            "“As far as companies holding bitcoin on their balance sheets, I think those types of buyers will be more rare,” McMillan said. “The volatility is something investors are paid to underwrite, whereas — for corporate treasuries — it’s potentially a much bigger headache to explain on a quarterly earnings call.”\n",

            "“Tesla’s purchase of bitcoin was a part of the company preparing to potentially accept it as a form of payment,” he said. “Should Tesla decide to pursue this payment option in the future, they may purchase more bitcoin in advance.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, Block (formerly Square) currently holds about 8,000 BTC worth roughly $150 million. The company, which invested $50 million and $170 million in bitcoin during the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021, respectively, recognized a bitcoin impairment loss of $36 million in this year’s second quarter.\n",

On Friday the largest cryptocurrency by market value rallied over 10 per cent to the $21,000 level, its largest daily gain in six months.Over the weekend the market gained, said Sathvik Vishwanath Co-Founder CEO Unocoin.

            "News Content: Once a cumbersome, niche currency touted in the internet's dark corners by technophiles and privacy advocates, bitcoin has infiltrated both popular culture and the financial mainstream. In 2021, cryptocurrency debuted on popular financial services, including Venmo, Robinhood and Cash App, and an increasing number of banks, conventional financial institutions and even nonfinancial firms are working hard to weave crypto into their offerings.\n",

In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailout, bitcoin was conceived as a digital alternative to fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, that would allow users to circumvent the authority of banks and governments. But as cryptocurrency continues to soar in popularity -- and becomes increasingly entangled in finance and commerce -- it may no longer be able to escape Uncle Sam's grasp.

Over time, and often in the wake of economic disasters, the US has codified a complex rulebook governing most types of financial transactions in order to protect the public, discourage fraud and insulate the economy from risk and peril. But the speed at which crypto is absorbing the interest and capital of American investors is pushing the issue to the forefront in Washington.\n",

            "In August last year, the Senate passed an infrastructure spending package to fund the improvement of old roads and bridges, expand high-speed internet access and address issues from clean drinking water to climate change. But an earlier draft included some significant provisions concerning the legislation of cryptocurrency. Of particular note was a proposition that would have required so-called \"crypto brokers\" to report tax data to the IRS, just like brokers of other assets such as stocks, bonds and commodities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, the cryptocurrency provision was cut from the spending package due to disagreements about the definition of who could reasonably be categorized as a crypto \"broker.\" Lawmakers could not come to a consensus about whether or not to include crypto miners, transaction validators and software developers.

            "News Content: Since late 2020, a steady hum has been emanating from 15 large metal containers sitting next to an electricity substation in the small community of Limestone in rural Washington County, Tennessee.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those boxes make up a bitcoin \"mine.\" Inside each one, a network of linked computers works to solve equations that keep bitcoin's decentralized network up and running. In exchange for solving these equations—for performing the work of keeping the bitcoin network alive—the mining computers are rewarded with bitcoins. This process is how bitcoins and many other forms of cryptocurrency are brought into the world; it's complex and computationally intensive, a little like running a video game with cutting-edge graphics.\n",
            "\n",
            "As anyone who has ever found himself feeling a burst of metallic warmth after pushing his laptop to its limits knows, that constant computational intensity means those boxes are hot—hence the hum, which is produced by all the fans needed to keep this bitcoin \"mining\" machinery from overheating.\n",

            "The Limestone bitcoin mine is a mutually profitable enterprise for both BrightRidge, the utility company that owns the substation, and the mine's operator, crypto company Red Dog Technologies.\n",
            "\n",
            "BrightRidge, which also owns the land on which the bitcoin mine is located, brings in revenue by selling excess power to Red Dog's power-hungry mine, which also happens to be its largest customer. Red Dog, meanwhile, says it expects to make a net operating profit of $36 million on its Limestone bitcoin mine over the next 18 months.\n",
            "\n",
            "Indeed, the mine seemed uncontroversial enough that the Washington County Commission unanimously voted to approve a rezoning of the BrightRidge property to allow for the construction of a \"block chain data center\" in February 2020 with no debate or discussion.\n",

            "Soon enough, however, the county began to change course.\n",

Red Dog responded by installing sound barriers, consisting of wood and sound-absorbent padding, while promising to do more to get the noise issue under control.\n",
            "\n",
            "The county wasn't mollified. Commissioners complained at public meetings that BrightRidge had misled them about the precise nature of this new data center, downplayed the noise it would make, and hid the fact that it wouldn't be operated by the utility company directly.\n",

            "On the other hand, court filings show that county staff were having meetings with employees from Griid (Red Dog's predecessor company) nearly a year before the county claims it first learned about the company and the real nature of its operation.\n",
            "\n",
            "In November, the county sued BrightRidge. The county's lawsuit argues that the rezoning of the property to an A-3 business agricultural district might have allowed a blockchain data center, but it didn't allow a \"Bitcoin blockchain verification facility,\" otherwise known as a bitcoin mine, and certainly not one operated by an undisclosed third party. (The zoning code itself is silent on what difference, if any, there is between a blockchain data center and a bitcoin mine, and therefore why one would be allowed but not another.)\n",

            "Cryptocurrency is no exception. The computerized mines that create and sustain these digital monies and the blockchain networks they're built on have raised the ire of private citizens and planning commissions alike. The former primarily object, sometimes reasonably, to the noise and vibrations emanating from the mines that open up next to their quiet rural properties. Planners and politicians, however, have taken some of those more reasonable complaints and used them as excuses to attack the mines for their power consumption, and the perceived damage they do to locally set goals of fighting climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "As cryptocurrency continues to rise in value, and some foreign countries put pressure on mining, these conflicts are likely to grow more numerous and less amicable. So even when officials are responding to real externalities, the rush to regulate could end up handicapping this new industry and even make some of the problems they seek to combat worse. Bitcoin and its attendant technologies will inevitably face many political and legal challenges in the coming years, but its first big regulatory fight won't be in Congress. Instead, it will be over a mesh of poorly designed local zoning laws.\n",

            "Keeping the blockchain current and accurate requires lots and lots of computers called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) plugging away at solving mathematical equations and earning new bitcoins for their efforts. The computations needed to keep the blockchain up to speed are complex. The bitcoins generated from mining go to the machines that solve them first. Those two facts mean you need a lot of ASIC machines burning through a lot of electricity to have a profitable mine.\n",

            "\"These ASICs are not energy efficient. They consume a lot of power,\" says Artem Bespaloff, CEO of Asic Jungle, which sells the machines to bitcoin-mining operations.

            "Indeed, bitcoin mining is so energy-intensive that many utility companies are actually trying to court these businesses. In some cases, they have offered incentives to set up shop near their power plants and substations in the hopes of getting a reliable customer to soak up spare power.\n",

            "The heat generated by banks of ASICs requires fans to keep everything cool. Those can produce a tremendous amount of noise as they spin, particularly at the scale at which bitcoin mines now operate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Traditional zoning regulations usually try to account for noise externalities by relegating heavy industry to specific areas of the city and setting decibel limits for those operations. That sometimes isn't enough to wholly account for the particular, and often constant, sound emanating from some bitcoin mines.\n",
            "\n",
            "The chief building inspector in Plattsburgh, New York—which has become something of a hub for bitcoin mining—told The Wall Street Journal that the problem isn't so much the volume of bitcoin mines, which is what decibels measure, but the irritating high-frequency pitch that they can produce.\n",
            "\n",
            "Other people who spoke to the Journal described the sounds of bitcoin mines as akin to the whine of a jet engine, a dental drill, or thousands of hair dryers blowing all at once.\n",
            "\n",
            "The vibrations can also apparently produce an unpleasant physical sensation. \"It's more than a noise. It's a vibration that you can feel across your whole body,\" said one resident who owns a farm near Red Dog's Limestone bitcoin mine to WJHL.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even when these mines sit in industrial areas, and often inside older industrial facilities, they still provoke complaints given that the fans hum at a consistent volume for hours at a time, unlike the more sporadic noises produced by industrial machines of old.\n",
            "\n",
            "In response to complaints from neighbors, some mine owners in the U.S. have switched to water-cooling methods, which produce less noise, or installed lighter fans that give off less sound. Some have also installed sound barriers and berths on the property—basically sound-absorbing walls that surround the mines themselves and which suck in some of the noise they give off.\n",
            "\n",
            "In many cases, the noise can be addressed through individual negotiation with mining companies. But it can still prove to be a burden on neighbors—what economists call a \"negative externality,\" or a cost born by someone who didn't choose to participate in a project, and isn't a party to any potential benefits. And these sorts of externalities can be difficult to resolve through private mechanisms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yet regulatory responses often have serious problems of their own. Cities have adopted bitcoin mining–inspired noise rules that are both heavy-handed and ineffectual. Plattsburgh, for instance, imposed an 18-month moratorium on the establishment or expansion of bitcoin-mining operations in 2018, which obviously attracted the ire of local miners and made starting or expanding bitcoin businesses impossible. And by grandfathering in existing operations, that moratorium obviously didn't address the immediate concerns of neighbors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there's Washington County, which launched a lawsuit against BrightRidge that was initially sparked by noise complaints. Yet one of the issues raised by the county against the company is that its approved site plan didn't include the noise barriers the county had later urged it to install. The county's complaint was that the noise was too loud and BrightRidge should do something about it—and also that the noise mitigation measures hadn't been approved.\n",
            "\n",
            "And noise complaints have served as catalysts for local governments to take a tougher approach to regulating all aspects of bitcoin mining. That was certainly the case with the nation's first true cryptocurrency zoning ordinance.\n",

In April 2017, the company Project Spokane set up its data center in an old timber mill in the small town of Bonner. In June, the mine was blessed by then-Gov. Steve Bullock with a $416,000 grant from the state's Big Sky Economic Development Trust Fund.\n",
            "\n",
            "Soon enough, however, the whir of fans coming from the Project Spokane site—which would later be taken over by the company HyberBlock—began attracting complaints from neighbors.\n",

            "\"Even some of the longtime residents that clearly remembered the noise from the lumber mill when it was operational at that site said this is very different,\" says Diana Maneta, the sustainability program manager for Missoula County's Community and Planning Services Department.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the lumber mill was loud, the noise it produced would come and go. Maneta says people described the consistent hum from the bitcoin mine as more like \"a jet engine that never lands.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Prior to the noise complaints, the Project Spokane facility, and indeed the entire cryptocurrency industry, wasn't on the county government's radar.

            "\"It's terrible for the environment,\" claimed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), who is fond of saying that the average bitcoin transaction uses more electricity than the average U.S. household uses in a month—a misleading statement since there's no direct link between the number of bitcoin transactions and the amount of energy that's needed to sustain the blockchain. Other critics point out that bitcoin uses as much energy as countries like Argentina or the Netherlands, without noting that industries like cement and paper production use even more.\n",

            "Beginning with a temporary zoning ordinance in 2019, which was then made into a permanent ordinance in February 2021, the county imposed a number of new restrictions on cryptocurrency mines. That included requirements that they locate in industrial areas and go through the process of getting special conditional use permits—which comes with additional noise restrictions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The most significant requirement of the zoning ordinance, however, was its green energy regulations. From now on, any cryptocurrency mining operation setting up shop in Missoula County would have to purchase or produce enough renewable energy necessary to offset 100 percent of a mine's energy use.\n",
            "\n",
            "Without this requirement, Maneta says the county would be at risk of not achieving its set climate goals of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's also a significant entry tax to cryptocurrency mining operations that might want to set up in the county. One of the draws of Montana is the fact that there's already so much plentiful cheap energy in existence. That advantage is negated when new mines have to either build out or purchase potentially more expensive renewable energy to cover all their consumption.\n",
            "\n",

            "Too often, however, governments' response to the racket—as the cases of Washington County and Plattsburgh show—has been to use heavy-handed rules to shut down the cryptocurrency industry rather than pursue peaceful coexistence.\n",

            "Elsewhere, companies are installing mines at oil and gas wells where they use spare fuel—that would otherwise be \"flared\" or burned off into the atmosphere—to power their operations. Those mines are thus reducing carbon emissions. Under Missoula's regulations, they'd still be required to build out more renewable power anyway.\n",

            "Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency generally, is a new industry that's hard for most people to understand and even harder for politicians to control. The result is a drive to quash or regulate it at all levels of government. As more and more cryptocurrency mines are set up in the U.S., it looks like the real threat to the industry isn't the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but rather the local county planning commission.\n",

            "News Content: A couple of enterprising Tesla owners have been using their electric cars to mine for cryptocurrencies or privacy tokens like Monero. According to them, the most profitable way to mine for crypto with a Tesla is to use a hacked firmware and hook graphics processing units directly to the electric motor. One Tesla Model 3 owner reveals that this way he was able to net up to $800 a month in Ethereum when the cryptocurrency was at its record price.\n",

            "Teslas, or any fully electric car, for that matter, are basically a giant computer on wheels, thought one Model 3 owner, and decided he can use the EV to mine crypto. Siraj Raval used every trick in the mining book - from connecting video cards to Tesla's battery, through hooking up their Apple Mac mini M1 to the 12V socket. He says that he was able to net $800/month in Ethereum's price heyday this way. According to him, the most profitable way to mine for crypto with a Tesla car is to use \"a mix of hacking into Tesla’s internal computer, plus plugging GPUs directly into the car’s electric motor.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Another Tesla owner, Chris Allessi, has gone even further. Since he got his Tesla before January 2017, he is entitled to a lifetime of superfast charging for the EV, and has used the free electricity from the car's battery to dig for Bitcoin with a Bitmain Antminer S9 directly. Alternatively, he has also tried hacking the Tesla's firmware and mining via the car's screen and browser by setting up a webpage that lets him dig for the Monero privacy token. \"It was no big deal,\" comments Alessi - Wisconsin’s first electric car dealer and a tinkerer by nature - \"I could run the mining program within the browser.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "How much did he make this way with his Tesla? A $10 worth of bitcoin for 60 hours as Tesla's GPU has a rather paltry 10 MH/s hashrate. Siraj Raval fared better, as he buys his GPUs used off eBay, mines for about 20 hours a day, and stakes the crypto with an exchange that gives him a good interest rate. This way he was able to net $400 to $800 a month while mining for crypto with his Tesla Model 3 last year. Still, according to Mr. Alessi, the whole Tesla Bitcoin mining exercise is just a proof of concept and not worth it in the long run:\n",

            "\n",
            "Introduction\n",
            "\n",
            "On 12 January 2022, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released a Discussion Paper on the expansion of the Hong Kong regulatory framework to stablecoins (e.g. crypto-assets pegged to fiat currencies). The Paper considers the adequacy of the existing regulatory framework in light of the growing use of stablecoins and other types of crypto-assets in financial markets, and the challenges posed by this increase in their prevalence. It further poses eight questions for consideration by the industry, including the scope of a proposed new regulatory regime to cover what the HKMA describes as “payment-related stablecoins”.\n",
            "\n",
            "This client alert provides an overview of the HKMA’s views on crypto-assets and stablecoins as outlined in the Paper, discusses the implications for players in the stablecoin ecosystem if the proposed changes are implemented, and suggested next steps for interested parties.\n",
            "\n",
            "The HKMA has requested responses to the Paper by 31 March 2022, and has indicated that it intends to introduce this new stablecoin regulatory regime by 2023-2024.\n",
            "\n",
            "HKMA’s views on crypto-assets and financial stability\n",
            "\n",
            "The Paper provides a valuable insight into the HKMA’s views on crypto-assets in general, and stablecoins in particular, including their linkages to the traditional financial system and ramifications on financial stability.\n",
            "\n",
            "In introducing its proposal to regulate payment related stablecoins, the HKMA has made it clear that while the current size and trading activity of crypto-assets globally may not pose an immediate threat to the stability of the global financial system from a systemic point of view, it does consider the increasing prevalence of crypto-assets to have the potential to impact financial stability. In particular, the HKMA has flagged that it considers the growing exposure of institutional investors, as well as certain segments of the retail public, to such assets as an alternative to, or to complement traditional asset classes, indicates growing interconnectedness with the mainstream financial system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Further, as noted by the HKMA, it understands that while Hong Kong authorised banks (Authorised Institutions or AIs) currently undertake only limited activities in relation to crypto-assets, AIs are interested in pursuing these activities further, given that they face increasing demand from customers for crypto-related products and services. This is consistent with what we understand is a steady increase in high net wealth investors hungry for yield demanding access to crypto-assets through their private wealth managers, as well as an uptick in demand from retail investors in Hong Kong eager for the same exposure to upside. To this end, the HKMA has flagged that it will soon provide AIs with more detailed regulatory guidance in relation to their interface with and provision of services to customers in relation to crypto-assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, the HKMA has also noted its concerns that the ease of anonymous transfer of crypto-assets may make them susceptible to the risk of illicit and money laundering / terrorist financing activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The HKMA’s views on stablecoins\n",
            "\n",
            "The Paper also flags the HKMA’s view that stablecoins are increasingly viewed as a ‘widely acceptable means of payment’ and that this, alongside the actual increase in their use, has increased the potential for their incorporation into the mainstream financial system. In the HKMA’s opinion, this in turn raises broader monetary and financial stability implications and has resulted in the regulation of stablecoins becoming a key priority for the HKMA, which has stated in the Paper that it wishes to ensure that such coins “are appropriately regulated before they operate in Hong Kong or are marketed to the public of Hong Kong”.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Paper goes on to identify a number of potential risks that may arise in relation to the use of stablecoins, including, in summary:\n",
            "\n",
            "Payment integrity risks where stablecoins are commonly accepted as a means of payment and operational disruptions or failures occur in relation to the stablecoins;\n",
            "\n",
            "Banking stability risks if banks were to increase their exposure to stablecoins, particularly if stablecoins were viewed as a substitute for bank deposits;\n",
            "\n",
            "Monetary policy risks in relation to the issue and redemption of HKD-backed stablecoins, which could affect interbank HKD demand and supply; and\n",
            "\n",
            "User protection risks where a user may have no or limited recourse in relation to operational disruptions or failures of a stablecoin.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given these potential risks, the HKMA has stated in the Paper that it considers it appropriate to expand the regulatory perimeter to cover payment-related stablecoins in the first instance, although it has not ruled out the possibility of regulating other forms of stablecoins as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "The HKMA’s discussion questions for industry consideration\n",
            "\n",
            "The HKMA has noted in the Paper that it considers ‘the need to regulate [stablecoins] is well justified and the tool to regulate…[can] be decided at a later stage’. However, it has indicated that it wishes for feedback from the industry and the public on the scope of the regulatory regime applicable to stablecoins, and to this end has set out eight discussion questions for industry consideration. A summary of the key questions posed by the HKMA, as well as the HKMA’s views on those questions, is set out below.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1 : Should we regulate activities relating to all types of stablecoins or give priority to those payment-related stablecoins that pose higher risks to the monetary and financial systems while providing flexibility in the regime to make adjustments to the scope of stablecoins that may be subject to regulation as needed in the future?\n",
            "\n",
            "In posing this question, the HKMA has noted that it intends to take a risk-based approach focused initially on payment-related stablecoins at this stage given their predominance in the market and higher potential to be incorporated into the mainstream financial market (as discussed above). However, the HKMA has noted that it intends to ensure that whatever regime is introduced is sufficiently flexible that it could extend to other types of stablecoins in the future. As such, issuers and traders of other types of stablecoins should not expect to avoid regulatory scrutiny forever.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 2 : What types of stablecoin-related activities should fall under the regulatory ambit, e.g. issuance and redemption, custody and administration, reserves management?\n",
            "\n",
            "The HKMA has proposed regulating a broad range of stablecoin-related activities, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "Issuing, creating or destroying stablecoins;\n",
            "\n",
            "Managing reserve assets to ensure stabilisation of stablecoin value;\n",
            "\n",
            "Validating transactions and records;\n",
            "\n",
            "Storing private keys used to provide access to stablecoins;\n",
            "\n",
            "Facilitating the redemption of stablecoins;\n",
            "\n",
            "Transmission of funds to settle transactions; and\n",
            "\n",
            "Executing transactions in stablecoins.\n",
            "\n",
            "This broad list is based on a list of activities in relation to stablecoins published by the Financial Stability Board[1] and as such may be viewed as in keeping with international standards. However, as discussed below in relation to Question 5, the breadth of this regime may raise concerns regarding the degree of overlap between this regime and others proposed by Hong Kong regulators, including the proposed VASP regime to be administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) (see our alert here).\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 3 : What kind of authorisation and regulatory requirements would be envisaged for those entities subject to the new licensing regime?\n",
            "\n",
            "The HMKA has suggested that it considers that entities subject to the new stablecoin licensing regime would be subject to the following requirements:\n",
            "\n",
            "authorisation and prudential requirements, including adequate financial resources and liquidity requirements;\n",
            "\n",
            "fit and proper requirements in relation to both management and ownership;\n",
            "\n",
            "requirements relating to the maintenance and management of reserves of backing assets; and systems; and\n",
            "\n",
            "controls, governance and risk management requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "Further, given that it is common for multiple entities to be involved in different parts of a stablecoin arrangement, the HKMA has noted that such entities could be subject to part or all of the requirements, depending on the services they offer.\n",
            "\n",
            "If requirements in relation to these matters are ultimately implemented by the HKMA, the stablecoin regime would cover some of the requirements of the proposed VASP regime, with the exception of requirements of reserves of backing assets, which will presumably only be applied to stablecoins given their nature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 4 : What is the intended coverage as to who needs a licence under the intended regulatory regime?\n",
            "\n",
            "The HKMA has signalled that it believes that only entities incorporated in Hong Kong and holding a relevant licence granted by HKMA should carry out regulated activities, to enable the HKMA to exercise effective regulation on the relevant entities. As such, it has stated in the Paper that it expects that foreign companies / groups which intend to provide regulated activities in Hong Kong or actively market those activities in Hong Kong to incorporate a company in Hong Kong and apply for a licence to the HKMA under this regime.\n",
            "\n",
            "If implemented, this would have significant ramifications for those global crypto-exchanges currently offering trading in stablecoins to Hong Kong users from offshore. These businesses would be faced with a choice between either incorporating in Hong Kong and seeking a licence, or discontinuing their trading for Hong Kong users.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 5 : When will this new, risk-based regime on stablecoins be established, and would there be regulatory overlap with other financial regulatory regimes in Hong Kong, including but not limited to the SFC’s VASP regime, and the SVF licensing regime of the PSSVFO?\n",
            "\n",
            "The HKMA has stated that it will collaborate and coordinate with other financial regulators when defining the scope of its oversight and will seek to avoid regulatory arbitrage, including in relation to areas which ‘may be subject to regulation by more than one local financial authority’.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, an HKMA-administered regime of the breadth proposed above would create a situation in which an exchange undertaking transactions in non-stablecoin crypto-assets would be regulated by the SFC under its proposed new VASP regime while being regulated by both the SFC and the HKMA under its stablecoin regime. In this respect, we note that the proposed definition of ‘virtual asset’ under the proposed new VASP regime ‘applies equally to virtual coins that are stable (i.e. the so-called “stablecoins”)’.[2] While the HKMA and SFC share regulatory responsibility for Registered Institutions (i.e. Authorised Institutions which are separately licensed by the SFC to undertake securities and futures business), that shared regulatory responsibility concerns distinctly different types of activities. In contrast, we consider that from an exchange’s perspective, the act of executing transactions in stablecoins is substantially similar to executing transactions in non-stablecoin crypto-assets. As such, this approach may lead to unnecessary and undesirable regulatory inefficiencies if exchanges are required to be licensed under both the SFC and HKMA regimes to undertake transactions in crypto-assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 6: Stablecoins could be subject to run and become potential substitutes of bank deposits. Should the HKMA require stablecoin issuers to be AIs under the Banking Ordinance, similar to the recommendations in the Report on Stablecoins issued by the US President’s Working Group on Financial Markets?\n",
            "\n",
            "While not expressly stating that it will not require stablecoin issuers to be regulated as AIs under the Banking Ordinance, the HKMA has indicated that it expects that the requirements applicable to stablecoin issuers will instead borrow from Hong Kong’s current regulatory framework for stored value facilities (SVF). However, the HKMA has signalled that certain stablecoin issuers may be subject to higher prudential requirements than SVF issuers where they issue stablecoins of systemic importance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 7 : [Does] the HKMA also have plan[s] to regulate unbacked crypto-assets given their growing linkage with the mainstream financial system and risk to financial stability?\n",
            "\n",
            "The HKMA has not expressly ruled out regulating unbacked crypto-assets, and has stated that it is necessary to continue monitoring the risks posed by this asset class. In stating this, the HKMA has also pointed to the VASP regime, suggesting that the HKMA’s approach to this area is likely to depend on the success of that regime once implemented.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 8 : For current or prospective parties and entities in the stablecoins ecosystem, what should they do before the HKMA’s regulatory regime is introduced?\n",
            "\n",
            "The HKMA has advised current and prospective players in the stablecoin ecosystem to provide feedback on the proposals set out in the Discussion Paper, and has noted that in the interim, it will continue to supervise AIs’ activities in relation to crypto-assets and implement the SVF licensing regime pending implementation of this new regime.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion\n",
            "\n",
            "The Discussion Paper provides a valuable insight into the HKMA’s plans for the future of stablecoin regulation in Hong Kong. While some concerns exist as to the potential overlap between the HKMA’s new proposed regime and the SFC’s VASP regime, it is clear that the HKMA intends to ensure that it is regarded as the primary regulator of stablecoins going forward, and that it sees the regulation of this asset class as closely linked to its key objective of ensuring financial stability.\n",

            "Title: This 25-year-old says he's a millionaire after investing early in ether and bitcoin\n",
            "News Content: Cooper Turley first started investing in cryptocurrency four years ago. Bitcoin, currently the largest crypto by market value, was trading at over $2,000 at the time, according to CoinMarketCap. Ether, which is powered by the Ethereum blockchain and is the second largest crypto by market value, was trading at a few hundred dollars. Turley bought both. Now, Turley tells CNBC Make It, those early investments have made him a millionaire, growing to be worth seven figures, with 90% of that generated in the last two years. (CNBC could not independently confirm documents detailing the transactions and current value of Turley's crypto holdings.) \"I definitely don't feel like I've 'made it' by any stretch — there are far more people who are far better off than me in crypto. But I do feel really thankful,\" says Turley, 25. Though Turley declined to disclose exactly how much he initially invested, \"it was not a lot at all,\" he says. \"At that point, I was still in college, working some ad hoc jobs. I was just putting a couple hundred dollars in, here and there.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "'I fell down this rabbit hole'\n",
            "\n",
            "Turley says he first invested in Ethereum while studying music business at the University of Colorado Denver in 2017. He learned that the Ethereum blockchain has the potential to change the music industry and help artists take more control over their own music — for instance, smart contracts on the blockchain could do things like expedite royalty payments directly to creators. \"From there, I fell down this rabbit hole of being fascinated by how the technology works and how I could make a name for myself and become an expert on the industry as a whole,\" he says.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once Turley graduated in 2018, he got more serious about his cryptocurrency portfolio, he says, even though both bitcoin and ether had recently plunged in value. \"In 2017, I saw my net worth basically come crashing down,\" he says. \"It was during the midst of two to three years, when everyone kind of wrote it off, that I was really heavily investing, putting basically all of my income just into ether [when it cost] around like $100.\" Of course, this was a very risky move — even today, experts warn to only invest money into crypto that you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are volatile, speculative investments. But Turley stuck with it. \"For me, in 2018, I saw this turning point where [Ethereum] was a shift away from speculation to actually building usable products,\" he says. By this, Turley is referring to the capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain, as it is used to power the creation of different decentralized applications like DeFi (or decentralized finance) and assets like NFTs (or nonfungible tokens).\n",
            "\n",
            "Diving into DeFi\n",
            "\n",
            "Turley felt that he had done enough research to understand what he was getting into, he says. \"I'm entirely self-taught — I started interacting with the Ethereum network a lot more,\" Turley says. \"I became fascinated with learning who the key players were and staying up on the latest trends.\" One of those trends was DeFi. DeFi apps aim to recreate traditional financial systems with cryptocurrency. Through DeFi lending, for instance, users can loan out cryptocurrency, as a traditional bank does with fiat currency, and earn interest as a lender. Except with DeFi, it's very risky. Still, Turley says he lent his ether and other digital coins and began to collect interest. Turley also made an even riskier play, borrowing coins himself so that he could then lend even more. All of this is known as yield farming, and it's extremely complex and risky. For one, there's not much protection if someone defaults on your loan. In DeFi, loan borrowers provide collateral with other crypto-assets, as the process is nearly anonymous. However, unlike with a traditional bank, borrowers using DeFi apps cannot be held accountable otherwise if unable to effectively pay back a loan. Indeed there are many risks associated with DeFi, including its lack of regulation and user protections — between January and April, for example, $156 million was stolen from DeFi related hacks, according to CipherTrace. \"The old crypto saying 'don't put in more than you can afford to lose' goes double for DeFi,\" according to Coin Desk. \"This stuff is uber-complex and a lot can go wrong.\" But Turley says he has been \"experimenting with that sector for a long time, so I felt very confident about making sure that I was checking in on how healthy my loan was,\" he says. In 2020, Turley experienced \"largely the most profitable few months of my career,\" he says, which was during what's known as \"DeFi Summer.\" At the time, there was a surge of technology being created within the space and investor interest with billions of dollars locked in DeFi applications. Since then, Turley has continued to invest and generate returns from DeFi, he says, while also working a number of jobs within the crypto space. \"It's a running joke at this point that I have an infinite number of jobs in crypto,\" Turley says. \"[I] just work on too many things.\" Now, Turley lives in Los Angeles and works in crypto strategy at Ethereum-based streaming app Audius. He is also an angel investor in the space, he says, and acts as an advisor for Variant Fund, a crypto venture firm. \"[I] have contributed to 50 plus crypto projects,\" he says, and am an \"investor in [roughly] 20 crypto projects.\"\n",

            "News Content: What if buying cryptocurrencies was as easy as online shopping? That’s what cryptocurrency investment platform KoinBasket promises its users.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now available in the UAE, the app offers cryptocurrency investing to users based on diverse themes and provides them with analysis on the asset class. It was created with the aim of solving the challenges faced by novice investors in studying and investing in assets such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n",
            "\n",
            "Similar to investing in index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), KoinBasket users can invest in a curated basket of cryptocurrencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "What is Bitcoin and how did it start?\n",
            "\n",
            "“The main reason why KoinBasket will be a game-changer in this market is because there is no know-your-customer process, which is the biggest headache for any user. All they need to do is use their cryptocurrency exchange credentials to browse through our baskets,” says Khaleelulla Baig, founder and chief executive of KoinBasket.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We also do not take custody of funds and assets. While retail investors usually connect their exchange accounts with third-party apps by sharing their secret API keys, which is a high security risk, KoinBasket allows them to invest in diversified crypto baskets without seeking access to their secret APIs.”\n",
            "\n",
            "It has, however, been a difficult year for cryptocurrency investors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitcoin plunged from a record high of about $68,000 last year to trade in the $20,000 range on Thursday, while the cryptocurrency sector’s market capitalisation has fallen below the $1 trillion mark.\n",
            "\n",
            "Analysts say that the cryptocurrency roller coaster ride is far from over, dragged down by this year’s equity bear market, global economic uncertainty, higher interest rates and a sharp rise in the cost of living around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "“When we do a comparative analysis between stock markets and cryptocurrencies, I use the analogy of the former being a mature, 40-year-old guy, which at the age of 15 was as volatile as crypto today,” Mr Baig says.\n",
            "\n",
            "Khaleelulla Baig is the founder and chief executive of KoinBasket. Photo: KoinBasket\n",
            "\n",
            "“Cryptocurrency is an adolescent asset class that needs to grow and evolve. Because we are still in the R&D phase, you will see a lot of fluctuations and crypto projects going bust. Once the market matures after five or six years, you will see more stability, Bitcoin not fluctuating more than 10 per cent and the top 10 cryptocurrencies being very stable.”\n",
            "\n",
            "KoinBasket’s engine compiles complex crypto data and analyses current market trends, past performance and valuations to create ready-to-invest thematic and sector-based baskets such as G.O.A.T basket, NFT & Gaming basket, Whale basket and more, tailored according to investor preferences.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is complicated and time-consuming for beginners to build a diversified investment portfolio and rebalance it. If people find a ready-to-invest ETF or an index fund kind of platform, it becomes easy, according to KoinBasket’s founder.\n",
            "\n",
            "A user can download the KoinBasket app, which is available on iOS and Android, and must have an existing cryptocurrency trading account, for example, in BitOasis, Coinbase or Binance. They can use the same login credentials to access the KoinBasket investment interface, pick a crypto basket and execute the trade in a single click.\n",
            "\n",
            "Through a single gateway, the user can choose several cryptocurrencies from a basket and execute the trade on the same environment without having to leave the screen and go to another application, doing another login. All frictions are removed, Mr Baig says.\n",
            "\n",
            "“When you come on KoinBasket, we are not just solving the problem of where you buy, we are also solving the problem of what you buy and how much you buy,” he says.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The exchange will never tell you what to buy. You will have to do your own research and then execute the trade. But on Koinbasket, we give you ready-to-invest baskets. As soon as you come on the platform, you find the most suitable basket and buy it in two clicks.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Investing in a basket of cryptocurrencies will often provide a well-diversified benefit compared with investing in just one or two big names, according to Devesh Mamtani, chief market strategist at Century Financial in Dubai.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The entire domain of cryptocurrencies is often confusing and becomes quite daunting to understand. This is primarily due to the complex nature of the underlying domain terms and the understanding of its primary and actual case,\" he says.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Cryptocurrency prices tend to be volatile, with the domain having seen a lot of flash crashes. Looking at the total number of trading pairs and exchanges in this domain can give the investor headaches.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Popularity drives the decisions to create specific crypto baskets, according to Mr Baig.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, a lot of people have been hearing about the metaverse. But how will they identify good projects in the metaverse or NFT space? That inspires the KoinBasket team to build crypto baskets.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We go out in the market, screen cryptocurrencies and segregate them into different classifications,” he says.\n",
            "\n",
            "“For example, we may find 100 crypto projects on NFT. Out of those, we select and screen six or seven and come up with a final basket.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The G.O.A.T basket includes cryptocurrencies that have withstood the test of time for at least five years, gone through two or three market cycles and made good returns for investors, while the Lambo basket is a high risk-reward basket aimed to help investors make quick money from small cryptocurrencies that are underpinned by solid fundamentals.\n",
            "\n",
            "The NFT & Gaming basket focuses on cryptos in the digital art and sports space, while the Whale basket tracks where large institutions are investing. Others include Halal basket, Web3 basket and DeFi basket.\n",
            "\n",
            "KoinBasket’s health check engine scours crypto data for red flags and lucrative investing opportunities to provide investors with alerts to take prompt action and rebalance portfolios.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although the platform is geared towards beginners now, it will allow expert investors to create their own crypto baskets and onboard users. This will happen in the next phase, maybe in the next quarter, Mr Baig says.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We will have a vetting process. We will not allow anyone to come and create a basket. We will speak to the person, understand the background, what's the performance and then allow them to proceed,” he says.\n",
            "\n",
            "KoinBasket aims to offer users the experience of a Web2 investment platform, but the product is Web3.\n",
            "\n",
            "“They’ve gone through a similar experience with mutual funds in stock markets. But they will now do it for cryptocurrencies in the fashion of a Web2 platform,” Mr Baig says.\n",

            "While every avatar is unique, some contain rarer traits than others. For example, over 9,000 of the NFTs are human men and women, but a select few are designs of zombies, aliens, and apes. Therefore, the NFTs with unique attributes may be more valuable than the others.\n",

Instead, they ended up with a successful NFT collection with a market cap of over $5 billion as of November 2022.

            "Remember that uniqueness is critical for collecting art, perhaps even more so in collecting NFTs, since thousands can be generated from a single algorithm. The “first of something” is generally more valuable (e.g., CryptoPunks, the first NFT collection; the first in an NFT series; the first series from an artist).\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, look at the NFT’s mission statement to understand the advantages of owning a specific NFT. Many NFTs now have utility beyond bragging rights, so examine what exclusive rights you’ll get by being an NFT holder (i.e., exclusive access to Discord channels or IRL events).\n",

            "\n",
            "What NFTs should I invest in? Any of the above NFTs could potentially make profitable long-term investments, but exercise caution. Before buying, be sure to look into the NFT’s liquidity, market volume, and long-term price performance. As is always true when investing in volatile assets (but especially NFTs), don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose.\n",
            "\n",
            "Why are NFTs so expensive? They’re scarce (even if the scarcity is artificial). Each collection contains a limited number of NFTs, and this perceived scarcity alone can drive up prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many NFT collections also have utility, giving owners exclusive access to events, merch drops, and even licensing rights. NFTs are inherently unique and non-interchangeable, meaning no one else has rights to the NFTs you own unless you sell them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, NFTs may be expensive due to a hype-fueled bubble. If you’re uncertain about investing in NFTs, it’s probably best to sit them out.\n",

            "Investor Takeaway\n",
            "\n",
            "The NFT collections presented here have been great investment opportunities. Many also give additional benefits like access to exclusive events, or voting rights on the project itself – benefits which could grow over time.\n",

            "Other collections can be developed to grow in value. For example, you can buy Sandbox LAND in a great location, and rent it to game developers or big brands looking to build assets in the Metaverse.\n",
